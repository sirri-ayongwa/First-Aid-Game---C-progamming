Multilevel First Aid Game - C Programming:
This multilevel First Aid game (AIDA) is a fun and educational console application developed in **C**. The game is designed to test and enhance your knowledge of basic first aid principles through a series of challenging missions. It features a dynamic scoring system, user interactions, and visual feedback, making it an engaging tool for learning first aid.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
There are many medical emergencies where time is of the essence. A sick or injured person may not be able to hang on long enough, until professionals arrive.
Sometimes when someone is injured, what they do to treat that injury can increase or decrease the likelihood of infection without a proper knowledge of what to do at that particular time, to ease the pain.
Not giving someone first aid can lead to death, but even if they live, they could deal with longer recovery time.

PROBLEM SOLUTION:
With the problems listed, I created a first aid program to educate, and enlighten non-expert persons and expert first aiders to have adequate knowledge of what to do when they are faced with some injuries.
